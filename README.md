# Movement-recognition-DS-project
My first DS projects that focuses on classification of movement type using data from accelerator.
To launch jupyter notebook with my final project you need to set up virtual environment
1. pip install virtualenv - to install library to operate with virtual environment
2. cd project_folder - choose folder where you want to create an environment
3. virtualenv venv - to create a virtual environment for project
4. source venv/bin/activate
5. place zip folder I submitted on cms in this venv and extract it
6. pip install -f requirements.txt - to install all libraries that are needed
7. python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my_env_name - to add venv in Jupyter
8. jupyter notebook - to launch jupyter Final project.ipynb will be in folder Final project.
